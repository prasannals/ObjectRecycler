A framework which helps minimize the memory footprint in Java applications. It helps in situations where you’re working with a lot of data but don’t have enough RAM/would prefer not to load all of it at once into the RAM. It basically has a constant number of objects in memory at any given time. If a new object of the give type has to be loaded, the oldest object in the memory will be pushed to persistent storage and the new object will be loaded. If the user wants the old object again, the newer ones are persisted and the old object is got back into memory. The client gets to specify how many objects are in memory, how the object get’s persisted and even how and from where the input data is obtained(The client will be required to implement Savable and InputSource interface to facilitate this).
